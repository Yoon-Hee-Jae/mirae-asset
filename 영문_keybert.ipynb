When the total population is listed in order of age, the middle age will increase to 63.4 years. According to the \"Future Population Estimate: 2022-2072\" released by the National Statistical Office on the 14th, the number of elderly people aged 65 or older, which is 9,436,000 in 2023, is expected to exceed 10 million for the first time in 2025 to reach 10,514,000. The elderly population will increase to 18.98 million in 2050 and then decrease to 17.27 million in 2072, with the proportion of the elderly rapidly increasing from 17.4% in 2022 to 47.7% in 2072. The production age population aged 15 to 64 is expected to decline rapidly from 36.74 million in 2022 to 34.17 million in 2030 and 16.58 million in 2072. In the 2020s, when baby boomers (born between 1955 and 1963) move to the elderly population, the production age population is expected to decrease by an average of 320,000 per year, and by the 2030s, the average annual decrease is expected to be 500,000. The median age is expected to rise from 44.9 in 2022 to over 50 in 2031 and to 63.4 in 2072. The total support ratio, which is the population (youth and elderly population) that needs to be supported per 100 working-age population, will rise from 40.6 in 2022 to over 100 in 2058 and to 118.5 in 2072. In terms of old age support costs alone, it is expected to increase from 24.4 in 2022 to more than 50 in 2036 and 104.2 in 2072, 4.3 times higher than in 2022. As of 2022, the population pyramid is expected to change into an inverted triangle structure, which is gradually becoming thicker than 60 years old, although it is a \\'jar type\\' with thick 30s and 50s. Compared to the international community, the percentage of working-age population in Korea is 71.1% in 2022, the highest among OECD member countries, but it is expected to be the lowest in 2072 (45.8%). Korea\\'s elderly population is 17.4% in 2022, which is lower than the OECD average, but it is expected to be the highest in 2072 (47.7%). Korea\\'s elderly support ratio is 24.4 in 2022, the lowest level among OECD countries, but it is expected to be the highest level in 2072 (104.2).'"
